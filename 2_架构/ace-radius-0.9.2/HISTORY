v0.9.2
    11/08/2009
    Added support for Windows platform via native Winsock2 API
    (tested on Windows XP using Visual Studio 2005).

v0.9.1
    23/07/2009
    ACE RADIUS library no longer depends on ACE (Adaptive Communication 
    Environment). Instead the code is changed to be POSIX-compliant and
    autoconf/automake toolchain is used for portability. 
    Dependency on threads library is also removed to make the library more 
    portable and versatile (e.g. now it can be used to implement PAM  
    RADIUS module).
    Major code re-factoring and coding style updates.
    New implementation of RadiusClientStack and RadiusServerStack classes.
