Introduction
------------

ACE RADIUS library is a portable open-source implementation of RADIUS protocol, 
as defined in RFCs 2865 and 2866. It's written in C++ and supports wide 
variety of POSIX-compliant platforms, including Linux and Solaris. 

ACE RADIUS library is licensed under BSD License, which allows its use both 
in open-source and commercial projects.

Building & Installing on Linux/Solaris platform  
-----------------------------------------------

Use the following commands to build and install ACE RADIUS library:
    ./configure
    make
    make install 

Additional configuration options may be passed to the ./configure script.
For example to compile the library with SunStudio 12 compiler on Solaris 
machine, use:
    ./configure CXX=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/CC
    make
    make install 

The library is installed into the /usr/local directory by default.
To change this, pass "--prefix" parameter to the ./configure script.

Refer to INSTALL file for additional information.


Building on Windows platform  
----------------------------

Open "ace-radius.sln" solution file in Visual Studio 2005 or later.
Build all solution components.


Test applications
-----------------

ACE RADIUS library is accompanied by a sample RADIUS client and server 
applications, located in the "test" directory. Run both applications
on the same machine (in two different terminal sessions) to verify the 
basic ACE RADIUS library functionality. If library works correctly,
you should see a "successful packet transmission" reported by the client.

You may also run sample RADIUS client and server applications on two
different machines and capture the traffic with some network sniffer
(e.g. Wireshark). To do so, use the following commands:
   on the 1st machine:   test/server
   one the 2nd machine:  test/client <IP address of 1st machine>
